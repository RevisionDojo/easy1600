Computer-based programs remove the requirement for certain musical compositional skills, and the program offers shortcuts and features that can help a computer-based “composer” resolve issues within the composition instantaneously.Text 2While composing music digitally may seem as if it only requires a few clicks of the mouse, it does not require fewer skills than does traditional music composition.
