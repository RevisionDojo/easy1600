While it is possible in theory for anyone to publish in <i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i>, <i>Ploughshares</i>, or a similar major poetry outlet, many people who do so have professional training in poetry and extensive practice writing it, which requires time not often available to those who must also work full-time jobs.
