Bainbridge and colleagues played a lullaby sung in the Scottish Gaelic language and a non-lullaby sung in the Seri language to a group of infants. The team found that the infants' heart rates decreased more during the lullaby than during the non-lullaby. Since a decrease in heart rate is associated with relaxation, the team concluded that the lullaby relaxed the infants. Noting that reduced heart rate can also be associated with increased attention, one critic argues that instead, the lullaby simply attracted the infants' attention. Bainbridge and colleagues also measured pupil size, as pupils typically become larger when a stimulus captures a person's attention.</p>",

The system considered the number of a ship's cannons and decks. “First rate” was the highest ranking, and “sixth-rate” was the lowest ranking, followed by unranked ships. This ranking determined the size of a ship's crew: first-rate ships had between 850 and 875 crewmen, while lower-ranked ships had fewer. Two of the ships in the British Royal Navy from this period were the <i>Dreadnought</i> (98 cannons and three decks) and the <i>Royal George</i> (120 cannons and three decks).
