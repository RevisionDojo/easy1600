Researchers hypothesize that this difference between the two feline species may be partly due to a U-shaped bone in their throats. <u>This bone is called the hyoid.</u> Jungle cats, which are much smaller than leopards, have a rigid hyoid that rumbles when the cat’s larynx vibrates, resulting in a purr. By contrast, leopards have a somewhat flexible hyoid, and the bone is attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that jungle cats lack. These traits allow leopards and most other species of big cats to roar. The same traits may also prevent most big cats from purring.</p>",

This ranking determined the size of a ship’s crew; first-rate ships had between 850 and 875 crewmen, while lower-ranked ships had fewer.
