To answer this question, Alicia Grasby et al. identified 30 extended-brand pairs (e.g., the same brand of wristwatch and necktie) in 52 weeks of purchases by approximately 60,000 households and, for each pair, calculated the change in probability of a brand in one category being purchased if the same brand was purchased in the other category.</p>",
